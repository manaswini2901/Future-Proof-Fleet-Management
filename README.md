## 🚛 Future-Proof Fleet Management: Data Insights for a Safer, Smarter Transportation

### 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on enhancing fleet safety and optimizing truck selection using data-driven insights. Our goal is to identify risky drivers, classify road safety incidents, and recommend measures to improve driver behavior and vehicle efficiency.

### 🔍 Problem Statement
Fleet managers face challenges in ensuring drivers adhere to safety regulations, mitigating risks associated with speeding, lane departure, and unsafe following distances. The objective is to:
- Identify risky drivers based on incident history.
- Recommend safety interventions.
- Optimize truck selection based on fuel efficiency and risk assessment.

### 📊 Methodology
1. **Data Collection & Transformation**: Processed fleet data to identify incident patterns.
2. **Risk Assessment**: Classified safety incidents per driver and assigned a weighted risk factor.
3. **Analysis & Visualization**:
   - Event distribution analysis for high-risk behaviors.
   - Mileage per gallon (MPG) analysis for truck models.
   - Extensive risk rating to determine optimal truck models.
4. **Recommendations**:
   - Implement safety programs for all drivers.
   - Introduce defensive driving education for high-risk drivers.
   - Install speed governors to cap vehicle speed at 75 mph.
   - Select **Volvo** as the preferred truck model for business expansion.
